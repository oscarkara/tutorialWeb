      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>CompSim is a virtual platform for hands-on learning about computer architecture and organization. CompSim includes an integrated approach to design studies and concepts related to hardware components and their functions, machine-level programming and performance analysis. CompSim includes a virtual hardware platform, called "Mandacaru", which has a conceptual processor (Cariri processor), Cache and RAM memories, system and peripheral buses, as well as support for data input and output devices (Keyboard and Video) . These virtual components were developed to help the study of different concepts of computer organization and architecture, such as instruction cycle phases, data representation in memory, machine-level programming and others.
      </p> 
      <br/>
      <h4>Simulator Functions
      </h4>
      <p> The simulator also has a graphical interface that allows configuring the components of the Mandacaru platform, programming an application to run on the conceptual processor, configuring, executing and visualizing the simulation and analyzing the system performance. The interface will be explored further on the graphical interface tab.
